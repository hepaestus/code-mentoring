## Welcome to My Code Mentoring GitHub Pages

[The Main Web Site](https://hepaestus.github.io/code-mentoring)

As an "expert" in Web Development, I would like to offer my mentoring services.

I have been a professional computer nerd for +25 years. I am interested in teaching others to code and in mentoring people as they move forward in their skills.

There are a few perks to learning to code, such as remote work, self employment, working from home, and making your own schedule. I have been working from home for more than five years.

The curriculum I am offering is as follows:
HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and Git (if you don't know what those are yet that is ok). With these tools you will be able to create your own custom web pages and even smart phone apps. If you have tried free online classes but had unanswered questions, I am here to help.

To participate you will need a basic computer of some type. A chromebook will work but will be harder to set up. An Ipad is not enough. A mac or basic pc/laptop should be all you need. You will need access to the internet as well. I will offer online meetings, and hopefully in person meetups, where we can share our work and communicate our ideas.

All ages are welcome. You should be somewhat familiar with using the internet; using Google for searches etc.

If this sounds interesting contact me with your email address and phone number.

I am currently offering this as a free service, but that could change in the future.
